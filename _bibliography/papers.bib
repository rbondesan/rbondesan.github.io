We show how to represent linear and non-linear layers as unitary quantum gates, and interpret the fundamental excitations of the quantum model as particles, dubbed “Hintons”. On top of opening a new perspective and techniques for studying neural networks, the quantum formulation is well suited for optical quantum computing, and provides quantum deformations of neural networks that can be run efficiently on those devices. Finally, we discuss a semi-classical limit of the quantum deformed models which is amenable to classical simulation.}

abstract = {We construct 1D and 2D long-range SU(N) spin models as parent Hamiltonians associated with infinite matrix product states. The latter are constructed from correlators of primary fields in the SU(N)1 WZW model. Since the resulting groundstates are of Gutzwiller–Jastrow type, our models can be regarded as lattice discretizations of fractional quantum Hall systems. We then focus on two specific types of 1D spin chains with spins located on the unit circle, a uniform and an alternating arrangement. For an equidistant distribution of identical spins we establish an explicit connection to the SU(N) Haldane–Shastry model, thereby proving that the model is critical and described by a SU(N)1 WZW model. In contrast, while turning out to be critical as well, the alternating model can only be treated numerically. Our numerical results rely on a reformulation of the original problem in terms of loop models.}

We discuss the computation of rectangular amplitudes and their modular properties, presenting explicit results for the case of free theories. In a second part of the paper we focus on applications to loop models, discussing in details lattice discretizations using both numerical and analytical calculations. These results allow to interpret geometrically conformal blocks, and as an application we derive new probability formulas for self-avoiding walks.}

In this paper, we determine the exact spectrum of these theories for all open boundary conditions preserving the full global symmetry of the model, generalizing recent work on the particular case M=0 [C. Candu et al., JHEP 1002 (2010) 015]. In the sigma model setting, these boundary conditions are associated with complex line bundles, and are labelled by an integer, related with the exact value of θ. Our approach relies on a spin chain regularization, where the boundary conditions now correspond to the introduction of additional edge states. The exact values of the exponents then follow from a lengthy algebraic analysis, a reformulation of the spin chain in terms of crossing and non-crossing loops (represented as a certain subalgebra of the Brauer algebra), and earlier results on the so-called one- and two-boundary Temperley–Lieb algebras (also known as blob algebras). A remarkable result is that the exponents, in general, turn out to be irrational. The case M=1 has direct applications to the spin quantum Hall effect, which will be discussed in a sequel.}
