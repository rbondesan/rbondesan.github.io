I am a Senior Lecturer at the [Department of Computing of Imperial College London.](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/)

I have a background in theoretical physics and before joining Imperial, I worked as an AI researcher and team lead at Qualcomm AI Research in Amsterdam.

My research focuses on quantum computing and machine learning applications in quantum physics.
